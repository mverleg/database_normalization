Database normalization
===============================

This package allows a description of dependencies and repeating blocks to automatically be converted to second normal form (third if you include all the keys explicitly).

It's a rather simple, proof-of-concept package. Dependencies are coded in Java, they might be read from a file at a future point (but perhaps not).

Encode the dependencies in TestDataGen and then execute Main.
